Astro is a modern static site generator that brings the best of both worlds: the simplicity of static HTML with the power of modern JavaScript frameworks.

## Key Benefits

### Zero JavaScript by Default

Astro ships zero JavaScript to the browser by default. This means faster page loads and better performance out of the box.

### Component Islands

When you do need interactivity, Astro's "islands architecture" allows you to hydrate only the components that need JavaScript, keeping your site fast and lightweight.

### Framework Agnostic

Use React, Vue, Svelte, or plain HTML - Astro supports them all. You can even mix and match different frameworks in the same project.

## Perfect for Content Sites

With Content Collections, Astro makes it easy to manage markdown content with type safety and validation. Combined with a CMS like Decap, you have a powerful content management workflow.
